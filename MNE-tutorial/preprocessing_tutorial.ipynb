    "Not all noise is outside the frequency range of brain activity and can therefore not just be suppressed by filtering. Some artefacts, like eye blinks, comprise large jumps in activity. Since such large shifts are unlikely to be related to brain activity, we can exclude parts of the recording where this happens. We do this by selecting a threshold value for the peak-to-peak amplitude. When we epoch our data, we exclude epochs that contain \"jumps\" of more than ±150 microvolts in the signal, i.e. epochs where the subject likely blinked."

The time window we establish span from 0.2 seconds before stimulus onset to 0.5 seconds after stimulus onset. The 200 milliseconds before the onset of the stimulus enables us to establish a baseline of \"no activity\", i.e. without stimulus presentation, which we can subtract from our time window with activity in order subtract away the background activity. The 500 milliseconds after the stimulus onset denote the time in which we expect the effect to occur, since the relevant EEG components for this kind of task arise within 500 milliseconds of stimulus onset.
